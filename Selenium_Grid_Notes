SELENIUM GRID
Total: we have 10 servers (virtual machines)
For automation we are using 3 (35 browsers in total) VMs
And regression takes about 3 hours
1 vm = 1 node
===============
selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -- this is selenium grid, we use same file for hub and node. We just need to specify role when we are executing this file.
-role hub --> for hub
-role nide --> for node
we can have only one hub, but we can have multiple nodes
Steps to run selenium grid.
1. Go to https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/ and download selenium server, this file has .jar extension
2. Go to https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.46/ and download chromedriver
3. Create folder selenium grid on your desktop and move to this folder selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59 file and chromedriver file. Make sure chrome driver file unziped.
4. Open terminal inside this folder
5. Execute command to start hub:

java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub

So default port is 4444. If this port is busy, change port:
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub -port 4445
Do not shut down terminal, before you stoped the proccess.
Click ctrl + c in the terminal to stop execution
6. Run the node.
open one more termianl and run this command. If port of your hub is dafault(4444), you can execute this command without changes.
//NODE WITHOUT CHROME DRIVER

java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register

//NODE WIHTH webdriver
java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="chromecriver" -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register

Later we will run node with chrome driver

java -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver="geckodriver" -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register


7. If we have done everything correctly, we should be able to see grid console. Go to localhost:4444/grid/console to view yout grid console.
The node is registered to the hub and ready to use --> this message means that hub and node are connected.
You may use port only once. If you have node (hub) running on the specific port, you need to choose different port
Go to terminal where you are running th hub, and observe node's information
Example:
Registered a node http://192.168.1.73:35584
35584 - port of our node
instead 192.168.1.73, use localhost. Becasuse we are running selenium grid locally,
clone https://github.com/vasyafomiuk/bookit-cucumber-junit.git or pull if you already have one
========================
in git basch

1. java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role hub

2. java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar -role node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register
